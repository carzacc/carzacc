## My GitHub Profile

However you might have stumbled upon this GitHub profile, you might want to know a few things about what is in it and what it's for.

I don't really have many ongoing open-source projects hosted here: there only really two and both are Flutter packages:

* [string_trimmer](https://pub.dev/packages/string_trimmer) to help you trim strings to a given length in various ways (contribute your own idea if you have one!);
* [flutter_stratis_plugin](https://github.com/carzacc/flutter_stratis_plugin) and its app implementation [flutter_stratis_gui](https://github.com/carzacc/flutter_stratis_gui) which is the wacky idea of giving a Flutter-powered Linux GUI to the [Stratis storage project](https://github.com/stratis-storage/), to which I've loved contributing every now and then to the CLI (some really early work on that) and, more recently, to the Bash completion script. The GUI project is on hold because I'm waiting for Flutter on Linux to be a bit more stable: I've had a lot of trouble getting even some basic stuff running and the API to get the C++ code interacting with the Dart code is unstable and has changed since I wrote the code for the plugin, so it doesn't work anymore.

The bulk of the rest of what you'll find are code examples for tutorials I've posted on [my blog at carmine.dev](https://carmine.dev) and on [my dev.to profile](https://dev.to/carminezacc). Also check out what I've written in [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/author/carzacc/), [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/carmine-zaccagnino/) and [in the September 2019 issue of PragPub](https://theprosegarden.com/store-cart66/#backissues).
