## My GitHub Profile

Hey there! However you might have stumbled upon this GitHub profile, you might want to know a few things about what is in it and what it's for.

I don't really have many ongoing open-source projects hosted here: there are really only two and both are Flutter packages:

* [string_trimmer](https://pub.dev/packages/string_trimmer) to help you trim strings to a given length in various ways (contribute your own idea if you have one!);
* [flutter_stratis_plugin](https://github.com/carzacc/flutter_stratis_plugin) and its app implementation [flutter_stratis_gui](https://github.com/carzacc/flutter_stratis_gui) which is the wacky idea of giving a Flutter-powered Linux GUI to the [Stratis storage project](https://github.com/stratis-storage/), to which I've loved contributing every now and then to the CLI (some really early work on that) and, more recently, to the Bash completion script. The GUI project is on hold because I'm waiting for Flutter on Linux to be a bit more stable: I've had a lot of trouble getting even some basic stuff running and the API to get the C++ code interacting with the Dart code is unstable and has changed since I wrote the code for the plugin, so it doesn't work anymore.

The bulk of the rest of what you'll find are code examples for tutorials I've posted on [my blog at carmine.dev](https://carmine.dev) and on [my dev.to profile](https://dev.to/carminezacc). Also check out what I've written in [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/author/carzacc/), [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/carmine-zaccagnino/) and [in the September 2019 issue of PragPub](https://theprosegarden.com/store-cart66/#backissues).

Oh! And, by the way, I've written a little 350 page book about Flutter! You can [get an ebook here](https://pragprog.com/titles/czflutr/programming-flutter/) or get a paper copy from your favourite shop (online or otherwise) by looking for *Programming Flutter: Native, Cross-Platform Apps the Easy Way* by Carmine Zaccagnino published by the Pragmatic Bookshelf. I've also translated it into Italian. The translation is published by Hoepli, it's called *Flutter. Guida allo sviluppo di app performanti e crossplatform* and you can [find it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.it/Flutter-Guida-sviluppo-performanti-crossplatform/dp/8820399482/).

Do you want me to cover some topic I've never written about? Do you have an issue with something in particular? Do you have a question or some feedback to give about my books? Feel free to [email me at carmine@carminezacc.com](mailto:carmine@carminezacc.com)!

Happy GitHub browsing!
